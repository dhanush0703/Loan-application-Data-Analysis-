# Loan-application-Data-Analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing 45,000+ loan application records from a finance company to uncover risk patterns, borrower behavior, and key drivers of loan default. The objective is to support data-driven lending decisions, improve the accuracy of loan approval processes, and help financial teams identify high-risk applicants more effectively.
